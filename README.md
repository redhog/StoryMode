# StoryMode

StoryMode is a website template for telling a story that spans both time and space:

It features both a timeslider / calendar and a map. When sliding through one to different images, the other one changes (zooms/pans) too.

# Build

```
cp -r data.example data

cd js
bower install
```

To tell your own story, edit data/story.js and put your own images in data/images!
